"""
Processes the Amazon book reviews data and splits it into train (75% of users) and test (25% of 
users) sets. Transforms data in each split into a user-book sparse matrix with a corresponding
vector of ground truth books indices (dense) for evaluation. Calculates the cosine similarity of
pairs of books based on the train user-book matrix.

*** Data processing steps: ***
(1) maps all parent_asins of books in books_by_parent_asin.jsonl (cleaned amazon books meta data) 
to integer book indices
(2) creates a dataframe of reviews with valid parent_asin, user_id, and rating >= 3 and maps all
parent_asins to book indices (as defined  in step 1), dropping rows with parent_asin not in mapping
** Train-test split and cosine similarity matrix construction steps: ***
(4) constructs user-book sparse matrices, TRAIN (75%) and TEST (25%), along with corresponding 
column vectors of ground truth book indices for evaluation, TRAIN_GROUND_TRUTH and 
TEST_GROUND_TRUTH.
(5) constructs sparse book similarity matrix of cosine books, BOOKS_SIMILARITY_SPARSE.

Args:
    Books.jsonl: The input dataset of Amazon book reviews.
    meta_Books.jsonl: The input dataset of Amazon books metadata in JSON Lines format, 
    which is used to map parent_asins to book indices to ensure consistency across datasets.

                             book for that user in the train split (or -1 if no book was held out).

    interactions are recorded in a CSR training matrix.

    Args:

             Data frame containing user reviews that are candidates for split. Must have columns

        total_n_books : int
                        Total number of books (columns) in the output sparse matrix. This should be
                        consistent across train and test splits and should be determined by the 
                        number of unique books you are interested in.
        total_n_users : int
                        Total number of users (rows) in the output sparse matrix. This should be

                            Column name containing integer user indices that we map to

    Returns: 
        split_matrix : scipy.sparse.csr_matrix

                       the split interactions (not held-out). Each row corresponds to a user and 
                       each column corresponds to a book. An entry of 1 indicates user and book 
                       interaction in split (not held out) and an entry of 0 otherwise.
        ground_truth : numpy.ndarray
                       Array of shape (total_n_users, ground_truth_set_size) containing
                       held-out book indices for each user. Each row corresponds to a user 
                       and contains the indices of the held-out books for that user. If no book 
                       was held out for a user, the row contains -1.
        split_compliment : pandas.DataFrame
                          Data frame containing the users that were not included in the split 
                          matrix. This is used to construct the test split after creating the 
                          train split.     

    Notes:
        - If a user has fewer or equal number of reviews in df to the specified 
          ground_truth_size or is not in split, they have value -1 for all entries in ground 
          truth vector.
        - If total_n_books or total_n_users is not provided, it will be set to the number of unique
          book or user indices in the input dataframe, df.

          dervied from the user_id and book_id using factorization or mapping to integer 
          indices. book_id should be derived from all books, not just those in reviews.
          similarly user_id should be derived from all users. ***
